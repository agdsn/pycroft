# This file is a workaround for a bug in docker-compose.  Once you use
# `extends` to extend from another file, you cannot use `extend`
# referencing to that same file anymore.  You must introduce another
# file.
# Also, these services have been suffixed `_base` to avoid name
# conflicts which trigger another bug.
# See https://github.com/lukasjuhrich/docker-compose-extends/ for some
# exploration of the behavior.
