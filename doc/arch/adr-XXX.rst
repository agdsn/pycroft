Context
-------
Benefit / Purpose of the decision, and what the technical context was that lead to it.
Should be written in a way that can be understood by any team member three years later.

Decision
--------
Things of the following kind:

- Instead of doing X like we always did, we're now going to do Y.
- We're starting to do X.
- We're not doing Y anymore because reason X which lead to Y is obsolete.

Consequences
------------
Immediate changes are X, to consolidate all things to Y requires such and such effort.
Long term effects are Z.
In the dailly work of a developer working on C, instead of just doing D, D' has to be done as well.
